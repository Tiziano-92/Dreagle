The code in this repository is part of the Dreagle structure. 

We are developing a product that provide to home users a Free Drones zone for their home airspace. 

The Code is divided in two parts, **User Interface** and **Hacking Interface**. 


##User Interface

The present code is responsible to read and control the user hacking options in a human readable way.

This is developed using HTML5 and node.js structure. 


##Use Cases


As a user: 

* I can login
* I can logout
* I can create/edit accounts
* I can check the status of the system and its batery (when it is available)
* I can turn on/off the hacking system
* I can define if the hacking should push the drones away
* I can download the log file
